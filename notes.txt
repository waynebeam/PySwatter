Move the game logic from the main function (what was I thinking!?) to the GameLogic class. 

That will allow using functions to update the class variables. 

Things like, for example, the fly starts off screen, and when it enters, then flip a flag that starts the timers. 

Or when a certain number of words are done, or a certain score, or flies, or whatever, then increase the speeds. Can be the fly speed, or the timers shirnking. 

Eventually can break the word list into words lists that are done by word length and can have the words get progressively longer, maybe. Just an option.
